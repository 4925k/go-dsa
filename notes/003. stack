A stack is a data structure that contains a collection of elements where you can add and delete elements from just one end (called the top of the stack). In the physical world, a stack can be conceptualized by thinking of plates at a dinner party buffet. When you go to take a plate, you can only remove from the top and similarly when you finish your meal, the stack of plates can only be built by adding them on top of each other â€” this is exactly what a stack in the software world does.

Stacks are a dynamic data structure that operate on a LIFO (Last In First Out) manner. The last element placed inside is the first element that comes out. The stack supports three operations - push, pop, peek.
