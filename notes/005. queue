Queues are similar to stacks, except they follow what is called a FIFO approach (First in First Out). 
A real world example would be a line at the bank. The first person to come in the line is the first person to be served. 
An example from the software world would be print jobs. 
For example, if multiple people are trying to print documents, it will be handled on a first come first serve basis.


The most common implementation of a queue is using a Linked List.
The two operations that queues support are enqueue and dequeue.

A queue is just an abstract interface, similar to a stack and can be implemented by multiple data structures, 
provided that they fulfill the contract of implementing enqueue and dequeue operations.
