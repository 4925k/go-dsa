/*
A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority value.
And, elements are served on the basis of their priority. That is, higher priority elements are served first.

Priority queue can be implemented using an array, a linked list, a heap data structure, or a binary search tree.
Among these data structures, heap data structure provides an efficient implementation of priority queues.
