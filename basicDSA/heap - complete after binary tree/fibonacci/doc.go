/*
A fibonacci heap is a data structure that consists of a collection of trees which follow min heap or max heap property.

In a fibonacci heap, a node can have more than two children or no children at all. Also, it has more efficient heap operations than that supported by the binomial and binary heaps.

The fibonacci heap is called a fibonacci heap because the trees are constructed in a way such that a tree of order n has at least Fn+2 nodes in it, where Fn+2 is the (n + 2)th Fibonacci number.
